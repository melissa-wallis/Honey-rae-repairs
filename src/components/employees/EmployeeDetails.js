// http://localhost:8088/employees =>  pulls the employees table 
// _expand=user => pulls and adds matching user key and adds that information to each employee. Adds fullName and email info we want
// &embed=employeeTickets => pulls and adds matching employee tickets key. Shows what ticket employee is currently working on (it is an array)
// &userId=${employeeId} => filters and returns only employee we've clicked on
