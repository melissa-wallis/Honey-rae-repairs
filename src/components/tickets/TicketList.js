/*
useState is a react function that STORES the state in a component, it returns an array. The array contains the initial state value at index 0 and a function that modifies the state at index 1. You then deconstruct those values into two variables e.g. [tickets, setTickets].

When the code runs, your variables will have new values:
tickets = empty array 
setTickets = function THE SETTER FUNCTION UPDATES THE DATA IN THE EMPTY ARRAY

THIS IS THE INITIAL CHANGE OF STATE IN A COMPONENT

--- 

useEffect is a react function that lets you OBSERVE state in a component and run instructions when the state changes.
